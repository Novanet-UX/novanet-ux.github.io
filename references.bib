  abstract = {This article presents nearly 10 year's worth of System Usability Scale (SUS) data collected on numerous products in all phases of the development lifecycle. The SUS, developed by Brooke (1996), reflected a strong need in the usability community for a tool that could quickly and easily collect a user's subjective rating of a product's usability. The data in this study indicate that the SUS fulfills that need. Results from the analysis of this large number of SUS scores show that the SUS is a highly robust and versatile tool for usability professionals. The article presents these results and discusses their implications, describes nontraditional uses of the SUS, explains a proposed modification to the SUS to provide an adjective rating that correlates with a given score, and provides details of what constitutes an acceptable SUS score.

  abstract = {Subsumed under the umbrella of User Experience (UX), practitioners and academics of Human\textendash{}Computer Interaction look for ways to broaden their understanding of what constitutes 'pleasurable experiences' with technology. The present study considered the fulfilment of universal psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation, meaning, security, or autonomy, to be the major source of positive experience with interactive technologies. To explore this, we collected over 500 positive experiences with interactive products (e.g., mobile phones, computers). As expected, we found a clear relationship between need fulfilment and positive affect, with stimulation, relatedness, competence and popularity being especially salient needs. Experiences could be further categorized by the primary need they fulfil, with apparent qualitative differences among some of the categories in terms of the emotions involved. Need fulfilment was clearly linked to hedonic quality perceptions, but not as strongly to pragmatic quality (i.e., perceived usability), which supports the notion of hedonic quality as 'motivator' and pragmatic quality as 'hygiene factor.' Whether hedonic quality ratings reflected need fulfilment depended on the belief that the product was responsible for the experience (i.e., attribution).

  abstract = {Many definitions of usability exist, but most of these are brief and imprecise. Usability describes systems and technologies that are self-explanatory to untrained users. Citations from medicine, nursing, allied health, and modern art and architecture were obtained. Key search terms used were usability, informatics, modern art and usability, structural design and usability, and electronic medical record and usability. Defining attributes were learnability, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Antecedents included human user, technology, information, and task. Consequences included user's perception of high degree of usefulness, efficiency, safety, and user's satisfaction with using technology. Empirical referents of usability were exemplified by measures of ability to use technology in a satisfying, meaningful, and productive way to meet the desired outcomes. Usability is theoretically defined as the degree to which the user perceives learnability, efficiency, and satisfaction when using a healthcare information technology system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

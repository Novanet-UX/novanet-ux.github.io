<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>In anticipation of an update to a shared discovery layer during the summer of 2017, Nova Scotia's consortium of academic libraries, Novanet, gave a mandate to the Novanet Usability Committee to conduct usability testing (UX) on the new user interface. With Novanet comprising eleven distinct institutions, the challenge to implement UX testing included a short time frame, inexperience with UX principles and practises, and designing a UX survey that would address the breadth of users of the discovery layer.</p>

<p>Approaching the UX testing with the goal of an easy and universal testing process for all institutions, we had to not only design and implement a UX survey, but also manage unexpected issues along the way, including varying ethics requirements at each institution and determining how to encourage engagement from all the consortium partners.</p>

<p>Preliminary testing took place in Summer 2017, with initial results indicating that some users experienced significant challenges in navigating the new interface. A larger UX testing program occurred in Winter 2018 using an updated UX survey that better captured data, and sampled a more representative participant pool.</p>

<p>This presentation will lay out the step-by-step process we used to design our UX test, recruit student participants, and analyse our results. We will discuss the challenges of UX testing in a consortial setting, and share some of the mistakes we made along the way. Additionally, we will explore an ever-present concern we wrestled with throughout the design and implementation of this project: could we--after going through the testing, analysing the results, and creating recommendations for improvement--actually create true change?</p>

presented by Digital Preservation Coalition and Software Preservation Network

- early years theoretical discussions focused on emulation and migration
- migration was key focus because emulation was difficult
- boundaries between software, data, applications are merging. where does data begin and software end?

## Brief History of Software Preservation 

- Paul Wheatley (DPC)

Yet to bridge a gap between archives and museums in terms of software preservation. Galleries have been more engaged, due to presentations. Home computing work in emulation has focused on computer games (especially archiving game walkthroughs).

## Challenges

- Jessica (SPN)

The field seems poised to move on this, re: born digital archives and special collections, growth of the IR landscape, increase in acquisition of hybrid collections, demand for reproducibility by funders, need for scalable emulation.

1. No single organization can collect all the software (and hardware) needed to facilitate access to digital data
	a. Implication: coordinated collection development and a mechanism to support sharing and reuse of software collections across organizations. Thinking about software as a collective resource

2. Copyright culture and DRM associated with software distributed on installation media
	a. Implication: Leverage existing legal tools. Build consensus about the software curation activities that are common across domains. 

3. Changing distribution models: we can't copy what we don't have in hand.
	a. Implication: aligning the shared needs/interests of representing the needs of cultural memory and research organizations. Coherent articulation of broad research and education reuse needs in discussions with ICT industry representatives. 

4. Emulation approaches have not scaled and there are dependencies on third-party emulators
	a. Implications: leverage existing ecosystem of digital preservation networks/service providers. Create a formal business model to support sustained development of emulators. Establish a network that facilitates distributed preservation, sharing, and reuse of software and configured software environments.

### Discussion

- William Kilbride

Who owns this problem?

- owned best by volunteers? Are big agencies able to walk away because of this?
- software is too general of a term, institutions must consider preservation as a niche. Preserve whats local, don't focus on global
- bake in software preservation into RDM, funding agencies should mandate this
